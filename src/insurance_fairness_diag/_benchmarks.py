"""
Premium benchmark variants following Côté, Côté and Charpentier (2025).

Reference:
  Côté, M.-P., Côté, S. and Charpentier, A. (2025). Five premium benchmarks
  for proxy discrimination in insurance pricing.

v0.1 scope: unaware and aware benchmarks only.
  - unaware  : the user's model (already fitted without S) -- model.predict(X)
  - aware    : refit model with S as a feature, then marginalise S out

Deferred to v0.2:
  - corrective (retrain without proxy features)
  - hyperaware (condition on S directly)
  - Pareto-optimal fairness-accuracy frontier

Proxy vulnerability per policyholder:
  proxy_vulnerability_i = unaware_i - aware_i

A positive value means the unaware model charges more than the discrimination-
aware counterfactual (the policyholder is disadvantaged by the proxy effect).
A negative value means the unaware model charges less (they benefit from proxy
correlation with a low-risk group).

    Premium benchmarks for proxy discrimination analysis.

    Attributes
    ----------
    best_estimate:
        Predictions from the user's model (unaware pricing -- S not in model).
        This is the same as unaware when the model was fitted without S.
    unaware:
        Predictions from the user's unaware model. Same as best_estimate.
    aware:
        Marginalised aware premium: E[model_aware(X, S) | X_legitimate].
        Estimated by refitting the model with S included, then averaging
        predictions across the reference distribution of S.
    proxy_vulnerability:
        Per-policyholder proxy vulnerability: unaware - aware.
        Positive = policyholder pays more than the fair counterfactual.
        Negative = policyholder pays less than the fair counterfactual.

    Compute the unaware premium: model predictions without S.

    This simply calls model.predict(X). The model should already have been
    fitted without the sensitive attribute. X should not contain the sensitive
    column (or it will be ignored by an unaware model).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model:
        Fitted model with a predict method.

        Feature DataFrame (should not contain the sensitive column).

    """
    Compute the marginalised aware premium.

    Steps:
    1. Refit the model on X WITH the sensitive column included.
    2. For each policyholder, predict under all observed S values.
    3. Average across S values weighted by the reference distribution of S.

    The result E[model_aware(X, S) | X] is the price that would be charged
    if S were marginalised out -- i.e., what a pricing actuary would charge
    if they used an aware model but then removed the direct effect of S.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model:
        Original fitted model. Must support sklearn's clone() interface, or
        have a fit() method. A fresh clone is fitted with S included.
    X:
        Feature DataFrame INCLUDING the sensitive column.
    sensitive_col:
        Name of the sensitive attribute column in X.
    weights:
        Exposure weights for fitting the aware model.
    random_state:
        Random seed (passed to the cloned model if it accepts it).
